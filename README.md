# SendMoods

## Send whatever fits your mood ðŸ¤ª

Inspired by [Sendme](https://www.iroh.computer/sendme), this aims to be a cross-platform peer-to-peer file transfer application for the people ~~and their moods~~.

This project is composed of 2ish parts*
* Sender
* Receiver

### Sender
This application is very WIP, currently exploring possibilities with wasm compilation and in-browser operation

### Receiver 
This application listens for [Iroh blob tickets](https://www.iroh.computer/docs/concepts/tickets) posted in my [twitch chat](https://www.twitch.tv/ubruntu), with a configurable `.env` file so that it can be for any twitch channel.
